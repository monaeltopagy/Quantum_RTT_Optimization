# Quantum-Annealing-Enhanced RRT Algorithm for Robotic Path Planning in Mine Detection and Clearance

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid approach combining the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm with quantum annealing for robotic path planning in mine detection and clearance. The goal is to develop an efficient and safe navigation system for robots to detect and clear landmines, addressing a critical global humanitarian issue. The project leverages classical RRT* for initial path planning and quantum annealing for global optimization, aiming to improve path quality and computational efficiency.

## Example outputs

### Example 1: Classical RRT* 

Input: Start = (10, 10), Goal = (400, 400), Obstacles = [ ( 100 , 100 ) , ( 200 , 300 ) , ( 350 , 150 ) ] [(100,100),(200,300),(350,150)] 

Output: A collision-free path from the start to the goal, visualized using Pygame.

Visualization: shown in **classical code output.jpeg**

### Example 2: Quantum-Enhanced RRT* 

Input: Same as Example 1. 

Output: A globally optimized path with reduced cost, leveraging quantum annealing.

Visualization: shown in **quantum code output.jpeg**
